# Automated Attendance System

Welcome to the Automated Attendance System repository! This project aims to streamline the attendance process in classrooms by leveraging automated facial recognition and voice recognition technologies. Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to set up and use the system effectively.

## Features Implemented:

1. **Automated Facial Recognition:**
   - The system utilizes a laptop's webcam to recognize students' faces as they enter the classroom or during class.
   - Facial recognition technology automatically updates the attendance record based on identified students.

2. **Voice Recognition for Roll Call:**
   - Voice recognition capabilities enable the system to conduct roll calls by recognizing and verifying student responses.
   - Students can respond verbally to mark their presence, streamlining the attendance process.

3. **Real-Time Attendance Dashboard:**
   - A user-friendly dashboard provides teachers with real-time attendance data.
   - The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of who is present, absent, or late, allowing teachers to quickly assess the class's attendance status.

4. **Attendance Analysis and Reporting:**
   - The system includes features for analyzing attendance trends and generating reports.
   - Teachers can identify attendance patterns and address issues like chronic absenteeism using the generated reports.
